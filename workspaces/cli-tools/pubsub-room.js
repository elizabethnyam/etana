// run it with node -r esm test.js
// it should list the keys on your ipfs node

/*************************************************
 * This example shows that it...does not work.
 * You can't use ipfs-http-client with ipfs-pubsub-room
 * because ipfs-http-client does not expose protocol and
 * stream API that is needed for direct connection between
 * peers in ipfs-pubsub-room.
 *
 * When trying to run the script we will get:
 *
 * `this._libp2p.handle is not a function`
 *
 * and ipfs-pubsub-room needs `handle` and `dialProtocol` to function.
 *
 * We still decide to keep this file in the repo as a reminder.
 *
 * See also: https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-pubsub-room/issues/28
